								<p>I have always been a arty / crafty person, and have only just started leatherwork in 2015. I do this in my spare time and love doing
								
								   it.&nbsp I have made a lot of items and given them away, so I need to start selling my leather pieces so I can buy more leather....it's
								
								   kind of an addiction now :)</br>

								   <p>The name &nbsp "Australian Red Ochre"&nbsp is a little bit of a mix of special things to me. &nbsp"Australian"&nbsp because</br> I am a Aussie girl 
									
								   through & through, the products I make are made here in the Whitsundays Australia. &nbsp"Red"&nbsp being the colour of this great land 
									
								   and also the colour of my beautiful Australian Cattle Dog, & Ochre, well, that's her name :)&nbsp Put them all together & we have</br>
									
								   "Australian Red Ochre"</p>

								   <p>I'm not the best at taking photos, and quite often the photos don't do the leather work justice (not bragging).&nbsp I'll get better
									
								   at taking photos....that's my next thing to learn...photography :)</p>
								   
								   Leather has a natural beauty and character,  no two pieces are the same making each piece of leather individual .

								   Leather is a natural material and can carry, scars, insect bites and natural markings. Treat these markings as its built-in Certificate of
								   
								   Authenticity &appreciate its unique characteristics.</p>

								   I don't put prices on my page because everything I make is different & unique. Pieces are priced dependant on how much
									
								   detail goes into each piece and each piece is only made once.&nbsp Everything is cut from quality Veg tan leather and hand
									
								   tooled / carved & hand stitched.</br>
								   </br>
								   Please PM if you are wanting to ask any questions.</p>
