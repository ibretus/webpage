								<h3>About Australian Red Ochre</h3>
						
							 
								<p>I have always enjoyed making and creating things & do this in my spare time. I have made a lot of leather items and given them away, so I need to start
									selling my leather pieces so I can buy more leather....it's kind of an addiction now :)</p><br>

								   <p>My brand name &nbsp "Australian Red Ochre"&nbsp is a little bit of a mix of special things to me. &nbsp"Australian"&nbsp because I am a Aussie girl 
									
								   through & through, the products I make are made here in the Whitsundays Australia. &nbsp"Red"&nbsp being the colour of this great land 
									
								   and also the colour of my beautiful Australian Cattle Dog, & Ochre, well, that's her name :) &nbsp Put them all together & we have</p><p>
									
								   "Australian Red Ochre" (ARO Leather) This is stamped on all my pieces...who knows, one day it might be sitting on a shelf  alongside a Versace :) :)</p><br>

								   <p>I'm not the best at taking photos, and quite often the photos don't do the leather work justice (not bragging).&nbsp I'll get better
									
								   at taking photos....that's my next thing to learn...photography :)</p><br>
								   								  
							   
								   I don't put prices on my page because everything I make is different & unique. Pieces are priced dependant on how much
									
								   detail goes into each piece and each piece is only made once.&nbsp Everything is cut from quality Veg tan leather and hand
									
								   tooled / carved & hand stitched.<br><br>
